# SDE Complements

The CCP provided SDE doesn't include all available static data. This is especially true for data related to newly added features. While some such missing data may be available through ESI, a lot remains missing from both the SDE and ESI.

This data may be obtained from third-parties which, for example, extract the data from the game client files.

One source of such complements is the [Hoboleaks Data Export](https://sde.hoboleaks.space/).
